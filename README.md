# joymap

a mappings engine for nintendo switch joycons (joycons must be bluetooth paired (should be universal but guaranteed on windows))
some programs will steal focus from the program, some have fixes. this program also doesn't work very well.

## some problems and fixes
1. minecraft doesn't work with it -> go to options/controls/mouse-settings/raw-input, set it to off

## to pair controllers on windows
1: go to settings/bluetooth devices/add device\
2: press left joycon pairing button until (Joy-Con (L)) appears, select it\
3: repeat for right joycon\
4: your joycons are paired, now start the program
