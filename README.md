# joymap

a mappings engine for nintendo switch joycons (joycons must be bluetooth paired (should be universal but guaranteed on windows))/
some programs will steal focus from the program, sometimes there are workarounds. this program also doesn't work very well./
if the joycon times out, restart the program.

## typing with joycons
to enter typeing mode press sl on the left joycon.\
use the arrow pad to select symbol\
### symbols: 
```json 
[
    "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm",
    "1234567890",
    "}{[]()\"'!&|/#,.?:=+-*%;^_\\<>~`@$",
    " \n\t"
]
```
press sl again to confirm the symbol, press sr to confirm and exit type mode.\
type mode is still new so it can lead to crashes

## some problems and fixes
1. minecraft doesn't work with it -> go to options/controls/mouse-settings/raw-input, set it to off

## to pair controllers on windows
1: go to settings/bluetooth devices/add device\
2: press left joycon pairing button until (Joy-Con (L)) appears, select it\
3: repeat for right joycon\
4: your joycons are paired, now start the program
